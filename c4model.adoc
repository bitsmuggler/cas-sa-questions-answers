== C4 Model

=== Why doesn't the C4 model cover business processes or workflows?

The focus of the C4 model is the static structures that make up a software system, at different levels of abstraction. If you need to describe other aspects, feel free to supplement the C4 diagrams with UML diagrams, BPML diagrams, ArchiMate diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, etc.


=== Which C4 views are quickly becoming obsolete?

Due to the hierarchical nature of the C4 model, each diagram will change at a different rate.

*System Context diagram:* In most cases, the system context diagram will change very slowly, as this describes the landscape that the software system is operating within.

*Container diagram:* Unless you're building a software system that makes heavy use of microservices or serverless lambdas/functions/etc, the container diagram will also change relatively slowly.

*Component diagram:* For any software system under active development, the component diagrams may change frequently as the team adds, removes or restructures the code into cohesive components. Automating the generation of this level of detail with tooling can help.

*Code diagram:* The level 4 code (e.g. class) diagrams will potentially become outdated very quickly if the codebase is under active development. For this reason, the recommendation is to (1) not create them at all or (2) generate them on-demand using tooling such as your IDE..
